Command to execute the code:
Put the code in a file with name 'input.txt' in the same directory in which lexical analyzer program is present.
Output will be displayed in console.

Points to be noted:
* The single line comments in our language start with '#' character and while giving the input file to lexical analyser, we first remove all the comments from the input file and then start the lexical analysis on it, so the comments wouldn't be shown in the console.

Status of code:
Working.
